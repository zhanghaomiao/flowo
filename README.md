## üö¶ Installation
- **Requirement:** Docker

### 1. Download
```sh
git clone https://github.com/zhanghaomiao/flowo.git && cd flowo
cp env.example .env
```

### 2. Installation Option 1 (Recommended)
This method pulls pre-built images, so you don't need to build them yourself. Note: The PORT is fixed at 3100 and cannot be changed. Set DOMAIN to your server's IP or domain.

Edit your `.env` file as follows:
```sh
# Application Settings
DOMAIN=localhost
PORT=3100
TZ=Asia/Shanghai

# Database Configuration
POSTGRES_DB=snakemake_logs
POSTGRES_USER=snakemake
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=snakemake_password
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

# Workflow Directory
FLOWO_WORKING_PATH=/path/to/flowo_project_dir
```

To start Flowo:
```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.release.yml up -d
```

Open http://localhost:3100 in your browser. If you changed DOMAIN, open http://yourdomain:3100 instead.

### 3. Installation Option 2 (Custom Build)
This method builds the images locally, allowing you to customize the PORT.

Edit your `.env` file as follows:
```sh
# Application Settings
DOMAIN=localhost
PORT=your_port
TZ=Asia/Shanghai

# Database Configuration
POSTGRES_DB=snakemake_logs
POSTGRES_USER=snakemake
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=snakemake_password
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

# Workflow Directory
FLOWO_WORKING_PATH=/path/to/flowo_project_dir
```

To start Flowo:
```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Open http://localhost:your_port in your browser.
