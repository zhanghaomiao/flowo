POSTGRES_USER=flowo
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=flowo_password
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432

# Workflow Directory
FLOWO_WORKING_PATH=/path/to/flowo_project_dir  # ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: set this to your workflow directory
```

Start the Flowo web service:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Open [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100) in your browser.
